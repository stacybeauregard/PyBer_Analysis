## Overview of Pyber Analysis

 The CEO of Pyber, V. Isualize has asked that we continue to analyze the ride disparities between three city types: urban, suburban and rural. How does each city type compare with total rides, drivers and average fares? We will need to put our findings into a chart so V. Isualize can easily see the results.
 
 ## Results
 The table below shows the three city types (urban, suburban, and rural) and their respective total rides, total drivers, total fares, and the average fare per ride and per driver.

 The table shows that while the urban city type is undoubtably popular (over 1600 rides and over 2000 drivers) it is not the most profitable. Meanwhile, the more rural areas that PyBer operates generate large fares ($55.49/driver) but doesn't seem to be utilized as frequently with only 125 rides in a four month timeframe.
 
 The below line chart puts this table into a more visually appealing and easier to read format. We can easily see that this is only a snapshot of information from January through April 2019. The was an uptick in rides in late February as seen with a sharp rise in each of the three city types. The chart also shows a clear disparity amongst the three different city types-they never intersect and there is a clear upper line, middle line, and lower line-urban, suburban, and rural respectively.

 ## Summary
 
 Our analysis should be quite helpful to V. Isualize to see how the three city types compare to each other. Some suggestions for PyBer to grow would be
 
 * The rural and suburban areas may not ever reach the same ride totals as urban as people tend to own their own cars living in these locations. PyBer should consider the busy lifestyle and commute length for these areas and look into expanding their business to not only be rides for people but also grocery delivery and perhaps contracting with local businesses for delivery of their wares.
 
 * Ride sharing in all city types could prove to be lucrative. Drivers could take on more fares with less mileage on their cars and more people would be getting where they need to be with less wait time.
 
 * Since there are so few drivers in the rural area, PyBer should look into driver incentives. One suggestion would be minor car maintenance reimbursement or a higher gas mileage reimbursement (or one if there isn't at all) to offset the time and gas it takes to go back and forth in the suburban and rural areas vs. the urban cities.
